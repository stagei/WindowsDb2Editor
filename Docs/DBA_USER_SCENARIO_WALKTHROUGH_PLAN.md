## Analysis Methodology

### **Code Review Approach**:

1. **For each scenario**:
   - Identify the UI element (dialog, menu, button)
   - Trace code path from UI → Service → Data layer
   - Document what's implemented
   - Document what's missing
   - Document what could be improved

2. **Code Files to Review**:
   - All `Dialogs/*.xaml.cs` - UI interactions
   - All `Services/*.cs` - Business logic capabilities
   - `Data/DB2ConnectionManager.cs` - Database operations
   - `Services/CliCommandHandlerService.cs` - CLI capabilities
   - `MainWindow.xaml.cs` - Menu structure and available features

3. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Compare implemented features vs DBA daily needs
   - Identify workflow inefficiencies
   - Propose enhancements for each scenario
   - Prioritize missing features (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
