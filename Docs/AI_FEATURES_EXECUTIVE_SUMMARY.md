## 🎯 What AI Does in WindowsDb2Editor

### Think of AI as Your **Personal DB2 Expert** Built Into the App

Instead of googling or asking colleagues, you **ask AI directly** within each window:

---

## 📍 Where AI Appears

### 1. **🎨 Mermaid Visual Designer**
**Button**: "🤖 Explain Relationships"

**You see**: ERD diagram with tables and foreign keys  
**You click**: Explain Relationships  
**AI tells you**:
```
"BILAGNR stores invoice numbers. FASTE_TRANS stores transaction lines.
They're related because each transaction belongs to an invoice (1:N).
The FK ensures data integrity - you can't add a transaction without 
a valid invoice. Common pattern: JOIN these to see invoice totals."
```

---

### 2. **📋 Table Properties Window**
**Tab**: "🤖 AI Assistant"

**Buttons**:
- 💡 **Explain Table** → What it stores, why it exists
- 📊 **Common Queries** → Show typical SELECT/JOIN examples
- ⚡ **Optimization Tips** → Index recommendations, performance
- 📚 **Generate Docs** → Auto-write documentation

**Plus**: Ask anything in text box!

---

### 3. **👁️ View Properties Window**
**Tab**: "🤖 AI Assistant"

**AI helps with**:
- Explain the view's purpose
- Break down the complex SELECT statement
- Show what tables it uses
- Suggest performance improvements

---

### 4. **⚙️ Procedure Properties Window**
**Tab**: "🤖 AI Assistant"

**AI helps with**:
- Explain what the procedure does
- Explain each parameter (IN/OUT)
- Show example CALL statements
- Document the logic step-by-step

---

### 5. **🔧 Function Properties Window**
**Tab**: "🤖 AI Assistant"

**AI helps with**:
- Explain what it calculates
- Show usage in SELECT statements
- Explain the algorithm
- Suggest better alternatives

---

### 6. **📦 Package Properties Window**
**Tab**: "🤖 AI Assistant"

**AI helps with**:
- Explain what application uses this package
- Summarize all SQL statements
- Explain why it uses certain tables
- Generate complete package documentation

---

### 7. **🔬 Deep Analysis** (Right-click ANY table/view)
**Menu**: Right-click → "🔬 AI Deep Analysis"

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Reads table/column **COMMENTS** (REMARKS from SYSCAT)
2. ✅ Extracts **sample data** (top 20 rows)
3. ✅ Profiles columns (distinct values, nulls, min/max, patterns)
4. ✅ Detects data quality issues
5. ✅ Masks sensitive data (passwords, SSNs, etc.)
6. ✅ Sends ALL this to AI

**Result**: AI understands your data like it's sitting next to you!

**Example**:
```
Without Deep Analysis:
AI: "STATUS is a CHAR(1) column."

With Deep Analysis:
AI: "STATUS stores invoice approval status with 3 values: 
     P=Pending (60%), A=Approved (35%), R=Rejected (5%). 
     Based on the data pattern, this is a workflow state column. 
     Consider adding a CHECK constraint to enforce valid values: 
     CHECK (STATUS IN ('P','A','R'))."
```

---

### 8. **🔬 Group Analysis** (Right-click MULTIPLE tables)
**Menu**: Right-click 3 tables → "🔬 AI Group Analysis"

**AI analyzes**:
- How the tables work together
- Business process they support
- Data flow between them
- Common queries across them

**Example**:
```
Selected: BILAGNR, FASTE_TRANS, KUNDE

AI: "This is a classic Order Management system. KUNDE (customers) 
     places orders that create BILAGNR (invoices), which have line 
     items in FASTE_TRANS (transactions). Data flows: Customer → 
     Invoice → Transactions. Common pattern: Customer dashboard 
     showing all invoices and totals."
```

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: New Developer Onboarding
**Scenario**: Junior dev joins team, doesn't know the database

**Solution**:
1. Right-click `INL.BILAGNR` → Deep Analysis
2. AI explains: "Invoice numbers table, stores invoice headers, 15K rows, updated daily by batch job, related to FASTE_TRANS..."
3. Click "Common Queries" → AI shows typical JOIN patterns
4. Developer understands in 2 minutes vs 2 hours of trial & error

### Example 2: Debugging Data Issue
**Scenario**: QA finds STATUS column has invalid values

**Solution**:
1. Deep Analysis on BILAGNR table
2. AI reports: "⚠️ Quality Issue: STATUS should be P/A/R but found 'X' in 12 rows (0.08%)"
3. AI suggests: "Add CHECK constraint to prevent invalid values"
4. Issue identified and solution provided automatically

### Example 3: Understanding Legacy Code
**Scenario**: Old package with cryptic SQL, no documentation

**Solution**:
1. Open package properties → AI Assistant tab
2. AI analyzes all statements + dependencies
3. AI explains: "This package processes daily invoice reconciliation. 
   Statement 1 fetches pending invoices, Statement 2 validates amounts, 
   Statement 3 updates status to Approved..."
4. Legacy code documented in minutes

### Example 4: Schema Comparison
**Scenario**: Need to understand difference between DEV and PROD

**Solution**:
1. Group select: DEV.CUSTOMERS, PROD.CUSTOMERS
2. AI Group Analysis
3. AI reports: "PROD is missing EMAIL column that exists in DEV. 
   Based on the data pattern in DEV, this column was added for 
   email notification feature. Migration script needed."
