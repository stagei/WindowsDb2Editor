## 🚀 What AI Will Do For You

Think of AI as **having a senior DBA sitting next to you** who knows your entire database.

### Ask AI Anything:

```
You: "Show me all customers who haven't ordered in 90 days"
AI: [Generates perfect SQL with JOIN and date logic]

You: "Why is this query slow?"
AI: "Missing index on ORDER_DATE. Add: CREATE INDEX IX_ORDERS_DATE..."

You: [Get DB2 error SQL0206N]
AI: "You typed BILAGDAT, column is BILAGDATO (with O). Fix line 3."

You: "What does table FASTE_TRANS do?"
AI: [Analyzes data, reads comments] "Stores transaction lines for invoices..."
```

## 📍 Where to Find AI

### 1. **Every Property Window** Has "🤖 AI Assistant" Tab
- Table properties → Ask about the table
- View properties → Explain the view
- Procedure properties → Explain parameters
- Function properties → Usage examples
- Package properties → Document the package

### 2. **Right-Click Menu**: "🔬 Deep Analysis"
- Analyzes **real data** + schema + comments
- Works on single table OR group of tables
- AI gets complete business context

### 3. **Mermaid Designer**: "🤖 Explain Relationships"
- Shows your ERD diagram
- AI explains why tables are related
- Business logic behind foreign keys

---

## 🤖 AI Provider Options

### **Ollama** (RECOMMENDED - Free & Private)
```bash
# Setup (5 minutes):
1. Download from https://ollama.com
2. Run: ollama pull llama3.2
3. App auto-detects ✅

# Benefits:
✅ 100% Private (data never leaves your PC)
✅ Free forever
✅ Works offline
✅ Fast responses
```

### **Cloud AI** (Optional - More Powerful)
- OpenAI (GPT-4o) - Best quality
- Claude (Anthropic) - Great for code
- Gemini (Google) - Fast & cheap

```
Requires:
- API key (costs ~$0.01-0.10 per question)
- Internet connection
⚠️ Data sent to external servers
```

**You pick** in Settings → AI Configuration!

## 🔬 Deep Analysis = The Secret Weapon

### What Makes It Special?

**Normal Analysis** (schema only):
```
Column: STATUS (CHAR(1))
```

**Deep Analysis** (schema + data + comments):
```
Column: STATUS (CHAR(1))
Comment: "Invoice status: P=Pending, A=Approved, R=Rejected"
Data Profile:
  - Distinct values: 3
  - Distribution: P (60%), A (35%), R (5%)
  - Pattern: Enum-like with 3 valid values
  - Quality: ✅ No nulls, consistent format
AI Insight: "This is a workflow state column. Consider CHECK 
             constraint to enforce P/A/R values."
```

### What Deep Analysis Extracts:

✅ **Table/Column Comments** (from SYSCAT.REMARKS)  
✅ **20 Sample Rows** (actual data)  
✅ **Column Profiling** (distinct, nulls, min/max, top values)  
✅ **Data Patterns** (sequential IDs, enums, dates, etc.)  
✅ **Quality Issues** (high nulls, inconsistencies)  
✅ **Relationships** (foreign keys, referenced by)  
🔒 **Auto-masks sensitive data** (passwords, SSNs, emails)

## 💡 Real Examples

### Example 1: Understanding Unknown Table

**Scenario**: You inherit a database with no documentation

**Old Way**:
1. SELECT * to see data
2. Check SYSCAT for foreign keys
3. Google column names
4. Ask team (if available)
5. Trial and error queries
⏱️ **Time**: 30-60 minutes

**With AI Deep Analysis**:
1. Right-click table → Deep Analysis
2. AI reads comments, analyzes data, explains everything
3. Click "Common Queries" → See typical usage
⏱️ **Time**: 2 minutes

### Example 2: Fixing Data Quality Issues

**Scenario**: QA reports "weird values in STATUS column"

**With Deep Analysis**:
```
Right-click BILAGNR → Deep Analysis

AI reports:
"⚠️ Data Quality Issue Detected:
 
 STATUS column should be P/A/R per comment, but found:
 - 'X' in 12 rows (0.08%)
 - ' ' (space) in 5 rows (0.03%)
 - NULL in 2 rows (0.01%) despite NOT NULL constraint
 
 Recommended fix:
 1. UPDATE table SET STATUS = 'P' WHERE STATUS NOT IN ('P','A','R')
 2. ADD CHECK constraint: CHECK (STATUS IN ('P','A','R'))
 3. Fix application code to prevent invalid values"
```

### Example 3: Learning Foreign Key Relationships

**Scenario**: Need to JOIN tables but don't know relationships

**Mermaid Designer**:
1. Generate ERD for INL schema (3 tables)
2. Click "🤖 Explain Relationships"
3. AI explains:
```
"BILAGNR (invoices) is referenced by FASTE_TRANS (transactions) 
 via BILAGNR column. This is a 1:N relationship - one invoice can 
 have many transactions.
 
 Common JOIN pattern:
 SELECT b.BILAGNR, b.BILAGDATO, COUNT(t.TRANS_ID) AS TransCount
 FROM INL.BILAGNR b
 LEFT JOIN INL.FASTE_TRANS t ON b.BILAGNR = t.BILAGNR
 GROUP BY b.BILAGNR, b.BILAGDATO
 
 Data flow: Create invoice first → Add transactions → Link via BILAGNR"
```
