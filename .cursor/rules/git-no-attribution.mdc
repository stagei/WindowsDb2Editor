# Git Commit Attribution Rules

**NEVER add any of the following to git commits:**

- `Co-authored-by:` trailers
- `Signed-off-by:` trailers with AI/Cursor attribution
- Any mention of AI, Cursor, Claude, or other AI tools in commit messages
- Any self-promotion or tool attribution

Git commits must appear as if written entirely by the human developer. The AI assistant is a tool, not a contributor.
