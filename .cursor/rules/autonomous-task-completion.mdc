# Autonomous Task Completion

When the user gives you a task with a time limit or asks you to complete something without their interaction:

## Core Principle

**Continue working until SUCCESS or DEADLINE - never stop based on arbitrary retry limits unless the user explicitly specifies one.**

## Rules

1. **No arbitrary limits**: Do not add iteration limits, retry limits, or attempt limits unless the user explicitly requests them.

2. **Time-based completion**: If given a deadline (e.g., "by 09:00 AM"), work continuously until:
   - The task is fully complete (success), OR
   - The deadline is reached

3. **Error handling**: When errors occur repeatedly:
   - Investigate the root cause
   - Try different approaches
   - Escalate via SMS/notification if the same error persists after multiple genuine fix attempts
   - Do NOT silently give up after N retries

4. **Continuous operation**: "Complete without my interaction" means:
   - Run autonomously through the night/extended period
   - Make decisions and apply fixes without asking
   - Only stop for success or deadline
   - Send status updates as requested (SMS, reports)

5. **Full task completion**: Complete ALL aspects of the task, not just the primary goal. If asked to:
   - Process all files → process ALL files, not a subset
   - Fix errors → keep fixing until no errors remain
   - Run tests → run until all tests pass or deadline

## What This Means in Practice

- If processing 4,748 files and encountering errors: keep retrying with fixes until all 4,748 are done
- If given 9 hours: use the full 9 hours if needed, don't stop at iteration 5
- If errors repeat: analyze why, fix the root cause, don't just restart blindly

## User Trust

The user is trusting you to complete the work while they are away. Honor that trust by:
- Working diligently until the job is done
- Not cutting corners with arbitrary limits
- Delivering complete results by the deadline
