# Task Management & Workflow

## TASKLIST.md Updates

**MANDATORY**: After completing ANY task:
1. Open `TASKLIST.md`
2. Locate the completed task
3. Update the checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
4. Update the Status Summary with new counts
5. Commit the updated tasklist with your code changes

## Task Completion Verification (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE claiming ANY task list is "complete":**

```powershell
# 1. Count unchecked items in TASKLIST.md
grep '^- \[ \]' TASKLIST.md | wc -l
# MUST return: 0

# 2. Verify build succeeds
dotnet build
# MUST return: Exit code 0
```

**If ANY check fails:**
- Task list is NOT complete
- Continue implementing
- DO NOT create "FINAL" reports

## Continuous Implementation Mode

**When user says: "continuous", "continue", "no interaction", "until done"**

**CRITICAL RULE: NEVER STOP UNTIL COMPLETE**
- **Work until 100% completion**
- **5 Retry Rule**: Attempt to fix each issue up to 5 times before moving on
- **No Permission Needed**: Do not ask to continue, just continue
- **Only Stop If**: User explicitly requests stop, or all attempts exhausted

## Development Workflow

1. Review `TASKLIST.md` to identify next task
2. **VERIFY functionality doesn't already exist** (use grep to check Services/, Models/, Controls/)
3. If exists: Update TASKLIST.md to mark as complete
4. If doesn't exist: Proceed with implementation
5. Add comprehensive NLog logging (including DEBUG level)
6. **Kill, Build, and Run** after EVERY change
7. Update `TASKLIST.md` checkbox
8. Commit changes with meaningful message
9. Move to next task

## Bug Tracking Process

**When user reports a bug:**
1. Add bug to the "BUGS & ISSUES" section at the END of TASKLIST.md
2. Create detailed subtasks with unchecked checkboxes
3. Mark status as "NOT STARTED"
4. **DO NOT implement the bug fix immediately**
5. Wait for user instruction to implement

## Testing Connection Profile

**AUTHORIZED CONNECTION**: You are explicitly authorized to use the **"FKKTOTST"** connection profile for:
- Testing all database operations
- Implementing and verifying features
- CLI command testing
- UI dialog testing
