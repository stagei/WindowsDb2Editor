# Documentation Standards

## Markdown Documentation Location

**CRITICAL**: All markdown documentation files MUST be created in the `MarkdownDoc/` directory.

**Rules:**
- All new `.md` files (except README.md) should be created in `MarkdownDoc/`
- Only `README.md` stays in the project root

## Documentation Token Economy (CRITICAL)

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Do NOT waste tokens on non-permanent/temporary documentation.

**FORBIDDEN - Non-Permanent Documents:**
- Progress summaries (use brief shell output instead)
- Interim status reports
- "FIXES.md" files that just describe what was fixed
- Duplicate documentation explaining what the code already shows
- Verbose implementation logs

**ALLOWED - Permanent/Reference Documents:**
- Architecture documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- API reference documentation
- Design specifications that inform future development
- Troubleshooting guides

**Token Saving Guidelines:**
1. **Instead of creating "FIXES.md"** → Add comments in code explaining the fix
2. **Instead of progress summaries** → Use brief shell Write-Host output
3. **Instead of verbose change logs** → Use git commit messages
4. **Instead of interim reports** → Report completion only
5. **Only create .md files that will be referenced long-term**

**When in doubt:** Ask "Will this document be useful 3 months from now?" If no, don't create it.

## Architecture Documentation Maintenance (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Keep `MarkdownDoc/APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` updated with ALL major changes.

**When to update APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md:**
- Adding new services, factories, or major components
- Creating new configuration files in `ConfigFiles/`
- Adding new dialogs or controls with significant functionality
- Changing data flow or component relationships
- Adding new database provider support
- Modifying the folder structure
- Adding new interfaces or design patterns

**What to update:**
- Mermaid diagrams showing component relationships
- Configuration file descriptions and their purposes
- Data flow sequences
- Provider support matrix
- Technology stack changes

**Update frequency:**
- After completing any feature that affects architecture
- When adding new specification documents (link them from architecture doc)
- During major refactoring efforts

**Example trigger scenarios:**
- Created `GlobalMetadataCache` → Add to architecture diagram and describe caching layer
- Added new `ConfigFiles/*.json` → Document in Configuration Files section
- New CLI commands category → Update CLI Architecture section
- New provider support → Update Provider Support Matrix
